# Findings-Classification

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the result of a complication of diabetes affecting the retina. It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. The ophthalmologist performs the diagnosis by screening each patient and detecting in ocular imaging the lesions caused by DR, namely, microaneurisms, hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, venous beading and neovascularization. A method using convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, fine-tuning and shallow machine learning classifiers is developed to identify the main ocular lesions related to DR and then use them to diagnose the illness.
